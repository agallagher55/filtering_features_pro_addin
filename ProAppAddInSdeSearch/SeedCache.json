These ratings are used to develop capital projects and provide network level analysis on these assets. The computer program enables us to see how these various asset conditions change over time depending on the amount of money allocated in the Capital Budget. We can also run various computer simulations on the various networks using different budget and rehabilitation scenarios to determine how we can get the most assets rehabilitated for the least amount of money.","Tags":"construction, Halifax, pavement, street, Nova Scotia, HRM, road","Credits":"","UseConstraints":"\u003CDIV STYLE=\u0022text-align:Left;\u0022\u003E\u003CDIV\u003E\u003CDIV\u003E\u003CP\u003E\u003CSPAN\u003EFor internal HRM use only.
