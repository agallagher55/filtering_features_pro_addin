All persons aged less than 15 are considered as never married and not living common law. \u0027Census family\u0027 is defined as a married couple and the children, if any, of either and/or both spouses; a couple living common law and the children, if any, of either and/or both partners; or a lone parent of any marital status with at least one child living in the same dwelling and that child or those children. All members of a particular census family live in the same dwelling. A couple may be of opposite or same sex. Children may be children by birth, marriage, common-law union or adoption regardless of their age or marital status as long as they live in the dwelling and do not have their own married spouse, common-law partner or child living in the dwelling. Grandchildren living with their grandparent(s) but with no parents present also constitute a census family. \u0027Census family structure\u0027 refers to the combination of relatives that comprise a census family.

This original inventory was developed to delineate and classify fresh and saltwater wetlands and coastal habitats to support policy and legislation, land use planning and impact assessment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and scientific research. All dominant wetlands and coastal habitat features greater than 0.5 hectares including bogs, fens, deep and shallow marshes, seasonally flooded flats, meadows, shrub and wooded swamps, lakeshore wetlands, salt marsh, saline ponds, dune, beach, cliff, and estuarine and marine flats were mapped using 1:10,000 airphoto interpretation. This dataset was integrated into the digital 1:10,000 forest cover from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources. Different years of photography were used for the counties. Cumberland County: 1985 and 1995; Colchester County: 1985 and 1994; Inverness, Victoria, Cape Breton, Richmond Counties: 1993; Kings, Annapolis, Queens, Lunenburg, Halifax, Hants Counties: 1992; Guysborough County: 1991; Pictou, Antigonish Counties: 1990 and 1997; Shelburne County: 1989; Yarmouth County: 1988 and 1989; Digby County: 1988. The above inventory took a number of years to complete. It was hoped that Landsat imagery could be used as a less costly and time consuming method of monitoring the changes within these delineated wetlands. At the same time this project was suggested, the new object oriented software program eCognition became available. ECognition uses segmentation which allows for grouping of pixels in a way that relates them to each other, as opposed to single pixels. As well membership functions, custom features, and nearest neighbour techniques can be used to classify the imagery. Essentially, the existing polygon boundaries were used and the classified vegetation types within were rolled up into the wetland types.
